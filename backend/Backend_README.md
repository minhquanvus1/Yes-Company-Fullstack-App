# YES-Company App (Backend)

- For the Backend, the app uses: Python Flask, SQLAlchemy, and PostgreSQL for the database.

All the backend code follows [PEP8 style guidelines](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/).

## Getting Started

### Pre-requisite and Local Development

- Developers should already have Python 3, pip and node installed on their local machines.
- For database, we use PostgreSQL. You can download it from [here](https://www.postgresql.org/download/).

#### Backend

To follow the best practice when working on a Python project, we will create a virtual environment for our project. This will keep your dependencies for this project separate from other projects.

```bash
# Windows users
cd backend
python -m venv venv
env\Scripts\activate
```

After creating the virtual environment, we need to change the Python Interpreter to the virtual environment that we just created, by clicking on the Python Interpreter at the bottom left corner of the VS Code, and select the virtual environment that we just created (by entering the PATH to the venv/ folder we have just created).

- **Install Dependencies**

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

- For the local database setup, this app uses 2 separate databases, 1 for Development, and the other one for Testing.
- The credentials of these 2 databases are stored in .env file (which is not included in the repository for security reasons), and load into the app in the config.py file. You can create your own .env file and store the credentials of your own databases (you can create 2 separate local databases yourself), and add their credentials to a .env file in this format:

```bash
# production database credentials
DB_USERNAME=YOUR_DB_USERNAME
DB_PASSWORD=YOUR_DB_PASSWORD
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_NAME=YOUR_DB_NAME
DB_PORT=YOUR_DB_PORT


# test database credentials
TEST_DB_USERNAME = YOUR_TEST_DB_USERNAME
TEST_DB_PASSWORD = YOUR_TEST_DB_PASSWORD
TEST_DB_HOST = localhost
TEST_DB_PORT = YOUR_TEST_DB_PORT
TEST_DB_NAME = YOUR_TEST_DB_NAME
```

- Then, after creating the local databases, and add their credentials to the .env file, you need to use flask-migrate to create the tables in the databases. You can do this by running the following commands:

```bash
cd backend
flask db migrate
flask db upgrade
```

- So after creating the virtualenv, install the dependencies into this virtualenv, and create the local databases, you can run the app by any of these 3 ways:

1. Run the app by using the Flask CLI:

```bash
# Windows users
cd backend
./my_env/Scripts/activate
export FLASK_APP=app
flask run --port=8080 --reload
```

2. Run the app by using Waitress (if you use Windows):

```bash
# Windows users
cd backend
./my_env/Scripts/activate
waitress-serve --listen=*:8080 wsgi:app
```

3. Run the app by using Gunicorn (if you use Linux):

```bash
# Linux users
cd backend
source my_env/bin/activate
gunicorn -b 0.0.0.0:8080 wsgi:app
```

The backend Flask application will run on `http://127.0.0.1:8080/` by default and is a proxy in the frontend configuration.

----- That is all for setting up the Backend to run the Backend of the app

## Testing

- For Testing, this app uses the unittest library in Python.
- All of these tests are run against the Testing database, which will automatically clean up after each test
- All of these tests require the JWT of the Manager, Customer to be able to run successfully (which I have already added in it).
- To run the tests, you can run the following command:

```bash
cd backend
python -m unittest -v tests/test.py
```

## Backend Folder Structure

- The Backend Flask has the following structure:

  - `backend/` folder: Contains all the source code of the Backend Flask.
    - `auth.py` file: Contains all the authentication and authorization functionalities of the Backend Flask.
    - `models.py` file: Contains all the models of the Backend Flask.
    - `tests/` folder: Contains all the tests of the Backend Flask.
    - `config.py` file: Contains the database credentials (loaded from .env file) for Development, and Testing
    - `app.py` file: Contains the creation of the Flask app, and the configuration of the Flask app.
  - `migrations/` folder: Contains all the migrations of the Backend Flask.
  - `venv/` folder: Contains the virtual environment of the Backend Flask.
  - `.env` file: Contains the credentials of the local databases.
  - `requirements.txt` file: Contains all the dependencies of the Backend Flask.
  - `production_schema.sql` file: Contains the schema of the Production/Development/Testing database.

## API Reference

### Introduction

- This app has 2 types of users: Manager and Customer, each of them has their own Role, and their own permissions to be able to access resources of certain endpoints, as for Role-based access control (RBAC)
- The JWT access token is required for all endpoints, and we will get this JWT after we log in successfully in the Frontend
  React

### Error Handling

- Errors are returned in JSON format as follows:

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": 404,
  "message": "Resource Not Found" // Notice that: there can be Custom Messages for each error
}
```

There are three types of errors:

- 400: Bad Request
- 404: Resource Not Found
- 405: Method Not Allowed
- 422: Unprocessable Entity
- 409: Conflict
- 500: Internal Server Error

### Endpoints

- I will demonstrate the endpoints for each Role, which are: Customer and Manager

## Deployment

- The Backend of the app has been deployed on Render. You can access it by clicking on this link: [YES-Company App (Backend)](https://yes-company.onrender.com/)
- This Backend API URL is also integrated with the Frontend of the app, which is also hosted on Render, so that the Frontend can interact with the Backend API.
