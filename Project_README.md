# YES-Company

- This is the fantastic app for YES Company, which is a company that sells products, especially the Bottles of Drinking Water.

- Before the advent of this app, the Manager of this company has to manually keep track, and try to remember all of the orders (including: all the order items in 1 Order and their corresponding quantity, total price, and on what date, at what time the customer requires the order to be delivered...) of all the customers, who make the orders by phone call. This is a very time-consuming and error-prone process, because the company is expanding at a very fast pace, and the number of customers is increasing day by day, so are their orders. Therefore, memorizing all the orders of all the customers is not quite a small task at all. On top of that, listening to phone calls continuously in a day is quite a headache for the Manager. Because of this, the Manager is not able to focus on other important tasks, which are also important for the company's growth.

- To solve this problem, the Manager wants to have an app that can handle these tasks automatically. So at the end of every day, the Manager just needs to check the app, and he will get all the details of all the orders of all the customers, who made the orders on the next day. This will save a lot of time for the Manager, and he can focus on other important tasks, which are also important for the company's growth.

- With the advent of this app, this app can help the Manager to get out of all this headache. This app allows users to register to be the company's customer, and make their order online, keep track of all their orders, total price, and deliver date. And Manager can see the Customer details (including their delivering address) and see all of the orders, with the quantity of each order item so that he knows how many bottles of drinking water he needs to deliver to the customers on the next day, as well as manage the orders.

- The techstack for the app includes: Frontend (React, Bootstrap), Backend (Python Flask), Database (PostgreSQL), Auth0 for Authentication and Authorization, Docker for Containerization, Render for Deployment.

* For more details about the Frontend, please refer to the [Frontend_README.md](frontend/YES-Company-Frontend/Frontend_README.md) file.
* For more details about the Backend, please refer to the [Backend_README.md](backend/Backend_README.md) file.
